pg 795 Complete reference

An anonymous class is a class that is not assigned a name. Goal of the required program below is to display the string "Mouse Pressed
in the status bar of the applet viewer or browser when the mouse is pressed.

import java.awt.applet.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
/* <applet code="AnonymousInnerClassDemo" width=200 height=100> </applet> */

public class AnonymousInnerClassDemo extends Applet{
public void init(){
addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() {
public void mousePressed(MouseEvent me){
showStatus("Mouse Pressed");
}
});
}
}

The syntax new MouseAdapter() indiactes to the compiler that the code between braces defines an anonymous inner class. Furthermore
that class extends MouseAdapter. This new class is not named but is automatically instantiated when this expression is executed.
Because this anonymous inner class is defined within the scope of AnonymousInnerClassDemo it has access to all of variables and methods 
within the scope of the class. Therefore it can call showStatus directly.

It allows us to create more efficient code.
