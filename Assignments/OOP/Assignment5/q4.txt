An applet must use multithreading if it needs to run continually because applets are event-driven programs 
which must not enter a “mode” of operation. 
For example, if start( ) never returns, then paint( ) will never be called.

Besides, having any time consuming processes on the Event Dispatching Thread can make the applet unresponsive.

Use q3-> the digital watch program to explain.
